## Overview of the statistical analysis:

After a visit to New York city and experiencing CityBike Kate and I wanted to research the possibility of opening a similar bake-sharing business in Des Moines, Iowa. Using Tableau, we developed a data analytics story that will help visualize the CityBike August 2019 numbers for our possible investor. Our goal is to show our interested investor the CityBike statistics and determine if opening a bike-sharing business is a possibility in Des Moines.

## Results:

We first analyzed the total number of rides for the month of August and broke down the rides by user type and gender. During the month of August there were over 2 million bikes checked out with the majority of checkouts coming from subscribers on the user end, and males on the gender end. Overall, all user types and genders average about 5 minutes per ride with males checking out the bikes over 70,000 times more than all other genders.  Based on this analysis we can make an early assumption that most bikes are checked out by males subscribed to CitiBike.

The next chart compares the start and stop time of bike checkouts throughout the week. This heat chart shows us that the highest usage of bikes takes place between 8 am â€“ 9 am and again from 5pm to 8pm. Overall the heat chart shows us that the highest bike usage time takes place during peak commuting hours.

The same heat chart is then filtered by gender. The filtered heat chart further supports the analysis of the previous heat chart as the highest usage is during peak commuting hours for all genders.

The Final heat chart compares user type rides with Gender rides, by weekdays. This heat chart confirms our assumption from the ride breakdown that most bikes are checked out by males subscribed to CitiBike.

Our final figure provides important ride data for our analusis. This figure shows that the majority of CitiBike's rides start and end in the Manhattan area. We also have charts showing the average peak hours in August and average trip duration by age. The average peak hours are once again dominated by peak commute hours further supporting figures 2-4. Additionally the average time per year shows us that in the past most older users were dominant, however there has been a quick increase in younger users.

## Summary:

Overall, the statistics show that most users of CitiBike NYC are local subscribers using the bikes to commute during peak traffic hours. To further analyze the user situation, we created two new charts the will help breakdown the user situation even further.

Trip Duration By Start Station: This heatmap was developed to show which start locations have totaled the most trip minutes. This map can help us determine if the longest trip times have been logged near tourist locations.

Trip Duration by User: This bubble map was developed to help determine which start stations are dominated by which type of user. Once again this can help us determine if non-subscribers dominate the bike stations near tourist locations.

![DurationMap](https://github.com/JoseEspinosaTello/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/images/MapDuration.png)

The Trip duration by Start Station heat map shows us that some of the bike stations that have logged the most time are located near Central Park. This would support use by non-subscribed tourists. Additionally, bike stations near major bridges have also logged huge amounts of time. This helps support the theory that the large majority of users are local commuters that use the bikes once they arrive on Manhattan Island. The Trip Duration by User map shows that local subscribers dominate all bike stations. However, non-subscribers have huge totals near Central Park and major bridge locations as well. This map solidifies that the majority of users are local subscribers as they have logged the most time at all stations, however, tourist have also logged major hours at popular tourist location and bridges.

After analysis of all maps the conclusion can be made that the majority of CitiBike NYC users are local subscribers. This is a great starting point for a bike-sharing business in Des Moines, as our investor will like knowing that a steady local cashflow will always be present. However, it is possible that New York is a special situation, and further analysis is needed to determine if there is a large number of commuters in Des Moines. New York is a city built on public transportation; therefore, their commuter numbers would be higher than most cities. The deciding factor will be how Des Moines compares to New York from a tourist standpoint. New York is also one of the top cities to visit in America, can Des Moines generate the same amount of tourist revenue? In order to make a final decision our team will need to analyze the commuter and tourist situation in Des Moines.
