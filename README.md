## Overview of the statistical analysis:

After a visit to New York city and experiencing CityBike Kate and I wanted to research the possibility of opening a similar bake-sharing business in Des Moines, Iowa. Using Tableau, we developed a data analytics story that will help visualize the CityBike August 2019 numbers for our possible investor. Our goal is to show our interested investor the CityBike statistics and determine if opening a bike-sharing business is a possibility in Des Moines.

## Results:

We first analyzed the total number of rides for the month of August and broke down the rides by user type and gender. There were over 2 million bikes checked out during the month of August with the majority of checkout coming from subscribers on the user end, and males on the gender end. Overall, all user types and genders average about 5 minutes per ride with males checking out the bikes over 70,000 times more than all other genders.  Base on this analysis we can make an early assumption that most bikes are checked out by males subscribed to CitiBike.

The next chart compares the start and stop time throughout the week. The heat chart shows us that the highest usage of bikes takes place between 8 am â€“ 9 am and again from 5pm to 8pm. The heat chart shows us that the highest usage time takes place during peak commuting hours.

The same heat chart is then filtered by gender. The heat chart further supports the analysis of the previous heat chart as the highest usage is during peak commuting hours for all genders.

The Final heat chart compares user type with Gender rides by weekdays. This heat chart confirms our assumption from the ride breakdown that most bikes are checked out by males subscribed to CitiBike.

Our final figure provides important ride data for our analusis. This figure shows that the majority of CitiBike's rides start and end in the Manhattan area. We also have charts showing the average peak hours in August and average trip duration by age. The average peak hours are once again dominated by peak commute hours further supporting figures 2-4. Additionally the average time per year shows us that in the past most older users were dominant, however there has been a quick increase in younger users.
